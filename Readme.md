Kali Linux lets you decide on Desktop Environment. If you decide to go the standalone window manager route for the sake of prettiness, and you decide to use compiz as a standalone Window Manager (don't do it) here's a quick and dirty way to generate a semi-decent menu for compiz-boxmenu. 

Requirements:

Kali Linux

Compiz Window Manager

compiz-boxmenu

pyxdg and python3-lxml

urxvt or your choice of terminal emulator if you decide to change that line of code, but let's be honest here, if you're using compiz as a standalone WM, you're probably using urxvt because it's just so darn pretty

You can get pyxdg with pip and python3-lxml and rxvt-unicode (urxvt) with apt
